    "# Introduction\n",
    "In developing countries, rapid economic growth is often associated with increased CO2 emissions, raising concerns about environmental sustainability. This study aims to analyze the relationship between economic growth, measured by GDP, and CO2 emissions as an indicator of environmental sustainability. The hypothesis is that at lower levels of GDP, economic growth contributes to higher emissions, but after reaching a certain threshold, further growth could lead to a reduction in emissions—a concept known as the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). The research seeks to identify this tipping point, using global datasets such as World Development Indicators and CO2 emissions databases."
